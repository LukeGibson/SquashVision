Bug fix - When contactInner was eroded too much was incorrectly apating it to be the same as contactMask 

Thresholds -
	120: 0, 0, 0
	160: 0, 0.66, contactOuterSize - contactSize
	200: 0.66, 0.83, contactSize - contactInnerSize
	240: 0.83, 1, contactInnerSize

difference = thresholdB - thresholdA
proprotionMaxContact =  maxCount / trueContactSize
probability = thresholdA + (difference * proprotionMaxContact)
