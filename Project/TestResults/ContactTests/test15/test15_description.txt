TEST 11 - with line misdetection last frame overwrite
    number of frames decided by how much over the threshold the gradRate was
    < 0.095: [-1, 0, +1, +2]
    >= 0.095 and < 0.14: [-1, 0, +1]
    >= 0.14: [-1, 0]


Gradient from point 3 frames before to current 
Noise removed from gradient points â€“ averaged with 2 neighbours
Rate of Gradient change from previous point calculated
First Rate of Gradient change > 0.08 = 1 frames before contact point
