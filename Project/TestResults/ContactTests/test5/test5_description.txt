TEST 2 - with gradient calc bug fix!
    No longer calculates grad if either of the points was of a non-detected ball (-1, -1, 0) point

Gradient from point 3 frames before to current 
Noise removed from gradient points â€“ averaged with 2 neighbours
Rate of Gradient change from previous point calculated
First Rate of Gradient change > 0.08 = 1 frames before contact
