TEST 7 - with gradRate threshold set at 0.075

number of frames decided by how much over the threshold the gradRate was
< 0.1: [-1, 0, +1, +2]
>= 0.1 and < 0.16: [-1, 0, +1]
>= 0.16: [-1, 0]


Gradient from point 3 frames before to current 
Noise removed from gradient points â€“ averaged with 2 neighbours
Rate of Gradient change from previous point calculated
First Rate of Gradient change > 0.08 = 1 frames before contact point
